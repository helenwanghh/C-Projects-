To start using C++, need two things:

- A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code
- A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand
There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below).
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.

Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code.


## include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
} 


To insert a new line, you can use the \n character:

Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World! \n";
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}

Tip: Two \n characters after each other will create a blank line:

Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World! \n\n";
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}


Another way to insert a new line, is with the endl manipulator:

Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}

Escape Sequence	Description
\t	Creates a horizontal tab	
\\	Inserts a backslash character (\)	
\"	Inserts a double quote character


Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

Example
// This is a comment
cout << "Hello World!";
This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:

Example
cout << "Hello World!"; // This is a comment
C++ Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler:

Example
/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing */
cout << "Hello World!";


Single or multi-line comments?
It is up to you which you want to use. Normally, we use // for short comments, and /* */ for longer.


## C++ Variables 
In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false
